# Ian Whitehouse
**Computer Science PhD student focused on neuromorphic and unconventional computing**

I am a student and researcher advised by [William Regli](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/regli) and [Wolfgang Losert](https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/318-wlosert.html). I work on unconventional computing substrates, including analog SAT solvers, neuromorphic algorithms, and living neuronal computers. I am interested in how computation emerges from continuous, nonlinear, and adaptive systems, and how this enables learning in regimes where deep learning is impractical.

### Research Focus

I investigate non-traditional computational methods, such as Ising, living, and neuromorphic computers. Key themes include:

- **Reservoir computing** as a framework for computation using high-dimensional dynamical systems  
- **Biological reservoirs** that bridge **in-vitro and in-silico neural dynamics**  
- Establishing **principled metrics for computational capacity** in physical and biological reservoirs  
- **Concept drift and continual learning** in time series, for systems that continuously adapt like the brain  
- Informing the **deployment of unconventional computing systems** for national security priorities  

### Background

I am a PhD student in the **University of Maryland Department of Computer Science**, advised by [William Regli](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/regli) and [Wolfgang Losert](https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/318-wlosert.html). I am affiliated with the [Losert Lab](https://losertlab.umd.edu/). I received my BS in Computer Science from **American University**, where I worked with [Roberto Corizzo](https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/rcorizzo.cfm).

Previously, I interned at:

- The **Army Research Lab**, working with neuronal recordings  
- **Leidos, Inc.**, creating adversarial learning algorithms and synthetic data modeling for underwater acoustics  
- **Lockheed Martin**, enhancing simulation capabilities for the radar of the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft  

### Publications, Presentations, and Resume

An updated list of my [publications and preprints](https://iwhitehouse.us/publications/) and the [presentations I have given](https://iwhitehouse.us/presentations/) are available on their respective pages.

A PDF of my resume is available on the [resume](https://iwhitehouse.us/resume/) page.

### Outside the Lab

When I'm not building, I enjoy cycling both long and short distances, board games, and trying new restaurants in the DMV.
