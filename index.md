# Biography

### Background
I am a computer science student at American University, and I plan to continue my education by pursuing a doctorate focused on machine learning.  During my undergraduate career, I have had the opportunity to work on numerous exciting research projects, including gravitational wave detection with novel autoencoders, multi-modal misinformation detection, and big data processing.  I am currently exploring LLMs and supervised decision-making neural networks through projects within my classes.  Over the next couple of months, I plan to share some of my projects through posts on this website, which can be viewed on the left sidebar.  In addition to research, I am currently an intern with Leidos within the Leidos Innovation Center and was previously an intern at Lockheed Martin within Rotary and Mission Systems.

### Research Interests
Currently, I am interested in autonomous agents and human machine teaming, including how autonomous agents can learn to make decisions organically, which is the focus of my capstone project.  In addition, I am interested in the interpretability of these agents, which I believe is central to their effectiveness in human machine teaming.  As self-driving cars become mainstream, I believe that making them interpretable is the only path towards them being trusted by average drivers.  I am excited to pursue these interests within my PhD program.
