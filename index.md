# Biography

### Background
I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland, studying under Dr. William Regli.  Over the last 4 years, I have had the opportunity to work on a broad collection of research, from gravitational wave detection with novel autoencoders and multi-modal misinformation detection, to building a life-size humanoid robot and operating a holographic capture studio.  I am currently working with Dr. Regli and other students on various projects focused on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.  In addition to research, I have interned at Leidos within the Leidos Innovation Center and was previously an intern at Lockheed Martin within Rotary and Mission Systems.  I enjoy riding my road bike, and I have completed [RAGBRAI](https://ragbrai.com/) since I was 10.  I also enjoy playing video games (Factorio Space Age) and exploring DC.

### Research Interests
Currently, I am interested in the intersections of teaming, autonomy, perception and understanding.  Over the last couple years, in nearly every domain, we have seen AI agents perform incredible reasoning tasks only to be held back by an innability to percieve and understand their workspace or an inability to contribute to their human teammates.  I believe that there isn't an easy solution to each of these challenges, which is what excites me to research them.
