Welcome!  My name is Ian, and I'm excited to begin to build out my web presence.  As my busy senior year wraps up, I look forward to posting some of the work I'm proud of on this site, and I hope that it will be a good overview of my undergraduate (and hopefully doctoral!!!) career.  I have a final project in 3 different classes, so I'm working hard on material for this site.  In addition, the first paper I am the primary author of was just accepted to an IEEE conference at the end of the year, so I'm incredibly excited to share more information on that.

For now, please feel free to reach out to me at [iw9892a@american.edu](mailto:iw9892a@american.edu), or at Linkedin at [iwhitehouse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iwhitehouse/).
